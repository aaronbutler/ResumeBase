Resume with fake content and polymer elements
I had several goals with this version of my online resume:
-Use polymer paper elements to implement material design
-Use custom polymer elements where appropriate
-Make a responsive collapsible menu
-Use picture/srcset on this project so I don't forget it exists
-Make the page responsive

Many of the files come directly from the polymer project. The files that I created/customized are:
-index.html
-package.json
-Gruntfile.js
-.gitignore
-TODO.txt
-NotesForReviewer.txt
-css/*
-elements/*
-js/* (except for JQuery.js, picturefill.min.js)
-images/*
